ember-form-patterns
===================

This is the code for my lightning talk at Ember.js NYC on Jan 24, 2013. It demonstrates building up a small app and solving some common problems with forms that arise.

Each commit in the repo is specifically crafted to demonstrate one step in the process, so if you want to pick out how a specific feature is implemented, look through [the commit log][commit-log].


The last question I got at the meetup was about whether Ember Data converts strings to numbers automatically if you have a numeric attribute. I added a branch to this repo named "ember-data" to test this out with the latest build of Ember Data. It turns out that Ember Data does not convert it for you. Perhaps that code is not yet in master or I'm doing it wrong. I'd appreciate the feedback.
